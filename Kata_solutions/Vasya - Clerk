//
//The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. 
//Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.
//
//Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.
//
//Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and 
//sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?
//
//Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. 
//Otherwise return NO.
