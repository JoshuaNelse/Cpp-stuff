//Who likes it? - https://www.codewars.com/kata/5266876b8f4bf2da9b000362
//
//You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. 
//We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
//
//Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, 
//containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:
//
//likes {} // must be "no one likes this"
//likes {"Peter"} // must be "Peter likes this"
//likes {"Jacob", "Alex"} // must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
//likes {"Max", "John", "Mark"} // must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
//likes {"Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"} // must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
